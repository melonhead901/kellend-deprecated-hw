<BODY>
CSE 322<BR>Sample File for Lex/Yacc assignment.
<P>
This file is NOT a thorough test of all the features you should
be implementing, but it's a start.

This is text in the body; it should be left justified, not
indented, not capitalized, spindled, folded or mutilated.
<P>
Here's a break,<BR> which should format slightly differently 
from a &lt;P&gt;aragraph
<P>
Although "official" html ignores unrecognized tags,
in ratml they can simply be printed: <FOONLY>boo</FOONLY>
<A href="/"><Img border=-0 vspace=+5 src="nameplate.gif"></A>.
Ditto for recognized tags with "parameters," like <UL font=arial>; just 
print it, don't indent, &amp; don't expect closing  &lt;/UL>.
<P>
Don't forget that you're supposed 
<!--ima comment-->to be <!--ima
nother
comment-->ignoring ratml comments.  And note that the 
preceeding sentence contains TWO comments, not one long one, 
which makes the lex pattern slightly tricky...
Your lexer should
eat comments; no reason to bother the parser.
<P>
Here's a list:
<UL>
  <LI> This is item one of a list
  <LI>This is item two.  Lists should be indented four spaces,
    with each item marked by a "*" two spaces left of four-space
    margin.  Lists may contain nested lists, like this:
    <UL>
      <LI> Hi, I'm item one of an inner list.
      <LI>Me two.
      <LI> Item 3, inner.
    </UL>
  <LI> Item 3, outer list.
</UL>
This is outside both lists; should be back to no indent.
<P><P>
Final suggestions: although I do NOT intend to be picky about
grading, it certainly will be simplified if "diff" reveals few or no
differences between the output of your program versus mine on
this test file.  And speaking of grading, please be sure to
include your name as a comment in your code, document any ways
in which you deviated from the assigment (enhancements, etc.),
and if these features aren't revealed on this test file, please
include a short test file of your own.
