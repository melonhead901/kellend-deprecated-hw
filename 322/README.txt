UW CSE 322 was a class covering Formal Strucutres.

Topics covered:  Finite automata and regular expressions; 
context-free grammars and pushdown automata; nondeterminism; Turing machines
and the halting problem. Emphasis on understanding models and their 
applications and on rigorous use of basic techniques of analysis. 
Induction proofs, simulation, diagonalization, and reduction arguments.

I took this class in Winter 2010, it was taught by Larry Ruzzo.
