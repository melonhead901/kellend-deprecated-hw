BYACC/Java + JFlex Ratml demo
=============================
CSE 322: YaccZilla

CSE 322
Sample File for Lex/Yacc assignment.

This file is NOT a thorough test of all the features you should be implementing,
but it's a start. This is text in the body; it should be left justified, not
indented, not capitalized, spindled, folded or mutilated.

Here's a break,
which should format slightly differently from a < P > aragraph

Although "official" html ignores unrecognized tags, in ratml they can simply be
printed: <FOONLY> boo </FOONLY> < A href="/"> < Img border=-0 vspace=+5
src="nameplate.gif"> </A> . Ditto for recognized tags with "parameters," like <
UL font=arial>; just print it, don't indent, & don't expect closing < /UL>.

Don't forget that you're supposed to be ignoring ratml comments. And note that
the preceeding sentence contains TWO comments, not one long one, which makes the
lex pattern slightly tricky... Your lexer should eat comments; no reason to
bother the parser.

Here's a list:
  * This is item one of a list
  * This is item two. Lists should be indented four spaces, with each item
    marked by a "*" two spaces left of four-space margin. Lists may contain
    nested lists, like this:
      * Hi, I'm item one of an inner list.
      * Me two.
      * Item 3, inner.
  * Item 3, outer list.
This is outside both lists; should be back to no indent.


Final suggestions: although I do NOT intend to be picky about grading, it
certainly will be simplified if "diff" reveals few or no differences between the
output of your program versus mine on this test file. And speaking of grading,
please be sure to include your name as a comment in your code, document any ways
in which you deviated from the assigment (enhancements, etc.), and if these
features aren't revealed on this test file, please include a short test file of
your own.
