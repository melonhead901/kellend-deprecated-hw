# Describe how to print rhubarb to standard out using the given commands

mkdir rhubarb - Makes a rhubarb directory
cd rhubarb - Navigate into directory
alias rhubarb='echo rhubarb >rhubarb' - Sets up an alias

1) rhubarb
   !! - This prints the text entered on the previous line and its output. This prints only rhubarb because rhubarb is an alias (see above) which generates no output. It also creates a rhubarb file/ 
2) cat rhubarb - This prints the contents of the file rhubarb to stdout
3) ls - This print the contents of the current directory, which contains only rhubarb to stdout
4) grep rhubarb rhubarb - This returns all the lines in the file rhubarb which contain rhubarb the search text rhubarb to std out
5) echo rhubarb - This print rhubarb to stdout
